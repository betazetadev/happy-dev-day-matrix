# Matrix Code Animation with Typing Effect

This project showcases a simple web-based animation inspired by the "Matrix" falling code effect. It features green cascading characters and a "Happy Programmer's Day" message that appears with a typing effect, accompanied by a blinking cursor. The text moves off-screen before repeating the animation.

## Features

- **Matrix-style falling code:** Continuous animation of random green characters cascading vertically across the screen.
- **Typing effect:** The "Happy Programmer's Day" message is dynamically typed out character by character, with a blinking cursor at the end.
- **Looped animation:** Once the text is fully written, it slides to the left, and the process restarts.

## How to Use

1. Download or clone the repository.
```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/matrix-typing-animation.git
```

2. Open index.html in a web browser to view the animation.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML/CSS:** For the layout, text animations, and styling.
- **p5.js:** For rendering the Matrix-like falling code animation.

## Customization

Feel free to modify the message, animation speed, or visual style by editing the `CSS` and `JavaScript` code within the `index.html` file.
